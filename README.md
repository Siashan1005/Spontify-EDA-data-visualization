# Spontify-EDA-data-visualization

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization to better understand the dataset and extract meaningful insights. The dataset comes from [insert dataset source, e.g., PetFinder, IMDB, CIFAR-10, etc.], and the goal is to analyze key patterns, relationships, and potential biases in the data. By applying EDA techniques, I aim to identify important trends that can inform feature selection, preprocessing strategies, and model performance improvements.

# EDA and Data Visualization
To begin, I performed data cleaning by handling missing values, checking for duplicates, and ensuring data consistency. I then explored summary statistics to understand distributions and key characteristics of numerical and categorical features.

For data visualization, I used histograms and box plots to analyze feature distributions and detect potential outliers. Correlation heatmaps helped reveal relationships between numerical variables, while bar charts and count plots provided insights into categorical feature distributions. Additionally, I created scatter plots and violin plots to examine relationships between different variables, helping to identify possible trends and clusters.

Through these EDA and visualization techniques, I gained a deeper understanding of the datasetâ€™s structure and potential challenges, setting the stage for more informed feature engineering and model development.
